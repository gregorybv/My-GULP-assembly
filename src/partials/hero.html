          Gulp-build is a powerful tool for automating the web application
          development process. I decided to make my own gulp build to streamline
          the workflow and speed up web application development.<br/>

          When creating my gulp build, I thought about the fact that every
          developer has different preferences and requirements to the
          development process. So in my build, I made sure to allow for
          customization to meet specific needs.
