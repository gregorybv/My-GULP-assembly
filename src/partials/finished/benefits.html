            Gulp provides ready-made plugins for many tasks, such as image
            compression, CSS and JS minification, file assembly, etc. These
            plugins can be easily customized and created according to your needs
            and requirements.

          <p class="benefits__subtext">
            With Gulp, you can automatically perform tasks, such as reloading
            the browser when files change, reducing the time it takes to set up
            the development environment and speeding up the overall development
            process.

          <p class="benefits__subtext">
            Gulp's syntax is based on an array of JavaScript, making it more
            intuitive and accessible for novice developers. In addition, because
            of its easy and flexible syntax, Gulp can be easily extended and
            customized.

          <p class="benefits__subtext">
            Gulp allows you to create local tasks for easier portability between
            projects. That way, you can update versions of plugins and tasks in
            one project without affecting others.
